  ### Who I Am

  Hi, I'm Jing, a frontend engineer with a background in UX design and product management.

  I love connecting creativity with logic—translating ideas into meaningful digital experiences that work beautifully and make sense.

  My keyword? Integration. I specialize in blending design creativity, development logic, and project management planning—turning abstract ideas into tangible digital products.


  ### Where It All Began

  My path hasn't been linear.

  I started in design research, exploring how people interact with systems. There, I discovered the power of design—how it can make complexity feel simple and bring technology closer to people.

  Later, in product development and project management, I learned to navigate uncertainty, make decisions amid ambiguity, and discovered what I truly love: building products.

  But I noticed the gap between design and engineering. Without technical understanding, design ideas often remain sketches instead of shipped products.

  So I decided to start over—studying information management, system analysis, and frontend development. Each step strengthened my ability to think structurally and communicate through code.

  ### What I Bring

  Design gave me sensitivity to detail and human experience. Engineering gave me the logic to turn creativity into solutions. Product management taught me to balance vision with reality.

  Today, I focus on frontend development—building interfaces that combine usability with clarity, guided by design thinking.

  I enjoy shifting between roles, acting as a translator between designers and engineers, helping ideas move from concept to execution.
